# 👋 Hi, I’m Atte Kivimäki

### Full Stack Developer | Musician | Finland  
### 🇫🇮 Finnish & English | 🧠 Continuous learner | 🌐 Open to remote & all Finland

I’m a career-changer turned web developer who loves building meaningful digital tools — clean interfaces, reliable backends, and smooth user experiences. I’ve spent the last 3 years learning, building, and collaborating on full-stack projects using modern JavaScript, TypeScript, and cloud technologies.

I enjoy researching solutions, breaking problems into steps, and delivering features that feel polished and intuitive.
